nnplus-custom
=============

ideas for new NN+ layout.

the browse page needs previews, 

the series page needs to be better condensed like the movie page. 


These files replace the files at newznab/www/view/templates/frontend/ 

You need to have ffmpeg working and previews available to you or else you get empty column. 
(future plan to have profile checkbox to enable/disable previews in list view)
